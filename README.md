# 🍕 Pizza Sales Analysis
This project demonstrates end-to-end data analysis using SQL for data preparation, exploration, and modeling, and Microsoft Power BI for data visualization and interactive dashboard development.
Using the Kaggle Pizza Sales Dataset (pizza_sales_analysis.sql), I built a full analytics pipeline that transforms raw transactional data into actionable business insights.
